# Standard game of Blackjack.

When ran, you will first see a deck of cards. This deck is will then be shuffled immediately afterwards. 

Then, you will be given the choice to "hit" or "stand"  for up to four players. For each turn you will see the player's hand.

Once the choices have been made, the dealer's hand is revealed and the values are then compared.

If you hit and receive a total value over 21 then that player "busts", essentially losing. 

If you have a higher value than the dealer then that player wins.

If you have a lower value than the dealer then that player loses.
